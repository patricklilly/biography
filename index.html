     <h2>Childhood : Chaos Reigns</h2>
       <p>In the early morning hours of September 29, 1984, a 10 lb 11 ounce giggling boy was unleashed upon the world. The nurses and doctors cooed with delight and the new parents were giddy with joy, but beneath his ruggedly handsome exterior this baby hid a thirst for chaos and destruction. From the time he could walk Patrick was known for delighting in the sound of shattering objects and the sight of falling food containers. Each adorable burst of laughter he let out was promptly followed by a heavy sigh and sense of dread from whichever parent was unfortunate enough to be within earshot. After a several sleepless years of devastation young Patrick began to part with his destructive ways and soon graduated to spending every waking minute playing outdoors, much to his parents delight.</p>

     <h2>Adolescent to Teenager : Let's Play Hockey</h2>
       <p>Patrick spent his middle school and junior high years of life rotating time between school, hockey, baseball, street hockey, hockey camps, and weekends at Lake Wawasee. After finishing in third place at the USA Hockey National Championships in 1997, Patrick identified hockey as something he would like to pursue with some ferocity. <strong>3 State Championships</strong>, <strong>2 Silver Stick Championships</strong>, and <strong>1 National Championship</strong> later and Patrick was sure his NCAA hockey was next calling. Fate, however had other plans. Prior to his senior year a nerve injury to the arm would effectively end his chances of playing beyond high school.</p>

       <h2>College and Young Adult : Pocket Aces</h2>
       <p>Like thousands before him Patrickâ€™s collegiate career began with a drive down Indiana State Road 37 to Bloomington. Shortly into his first year the world of online poker was growing rapidly and Patrick was swept up in the hysteria, after all it was relevant for some of his mathematical and economics classes so why not give it a try. Well a little luck rolled into a decades long career and has allowed Patrick to travel the country and call some great cities such as Chicago, Boston, and NYC home. While the events of April 15, 2011, will live in infamy for all online poker players of that era the ability to play online was hampered but not destroyed. However with all shiny things the patina eventually wears off and Patrick found himself looking out over the horizon for new adventures.</p>
